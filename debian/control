Description: This stack provides Python bindings for Qt.
 There are two providers: pyside and pyqt. PySide2 is available under the GPL, LGPL and a commercial license. PyQt is released under the GPL. Both the bindings and tools to build bindings are included from each available provider. For PySide, it is called &quot;Shiboken&quot;. For PyQt, this is called &quot;SIP&quot;. Also provided is adapter code to make the user's Python code independent of which binding provider was actually used which makes it very easy to switch between these.
